I'd be happy to provide some sample Python code to get you started with building a machine learning application for predicting Stanley Cup brackets. This code will cover the main components we discussed: data collection, feature engineering, model training, and making predictions.

Let's create an artifact with the code:

The code I've provided creates a comprehensive framework for predicting Stanley Cup brackets using machine learning. Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. **Data Collection**: The code includes functions to fetch historical NHL data and current season data. In a real implementation, you would connect to the NHL API or other sports data sources, but the example creates synthetic data for demonstration purposes.

2. **Feature Engineering**: The code transforms raw statistics into useful features like win percentage, points percentage, and team momentum.

3. **Model Training**: The system uses a RandomForest classifier with hyperparameter tuning to predict how far teams will advance in the playoffs.

4. **Playoff Simulation**: The code includes a Monte Carlo simulation approach to generate probability distributions for different playoff outcomes.

5. **Visualization**: The framework can generate visualizations of predicted outcomes.

To use this code with real data, you would need to:

1. Replace the synthetic data generation with actual API calls to NHL data sources
2. Add more sophisticated features (player statistics, injuries, etc.)
3. Fine-tune the simulation logic to better match NHL playoff structures and rules

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this code in more detail? Or would you like suggestions for expanding it with additional features?
